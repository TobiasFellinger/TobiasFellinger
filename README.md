Hi,

my name is Tobias Fellinger, I currently work at Austrias pharma regulatory agency AGES.

I was involved in the research project _"Statistical methods for time-to-event endpoints with non-proportional hazards in clinical trials pivotal for benefit risk decision making"_ implementing a simulation study and in the pilot project to include individual patient data in regulatory submissions.

I mainly code in R.
